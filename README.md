- 👋 Hi, I’m @bakraoui from morroco
- 👀 I’m interested with web development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reactjs, j2ee, nodejs, express.
- 💞️ My plan for 2022 is to learn Angular and Spring Boot . 
- 📫 this year I will be more active on my github account so I will work on other projects and share it here.
